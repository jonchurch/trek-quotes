# Random Star Trek Quotes

177 quotes from across the various shows and movies, for when you feel like boldy going where none have gone before.

Currently, we export a randomQuote function that will return a string with the quote on the first line, and a newline followed by attribution

```
const trek = require('trek-quotes')

console.log(trek.randomQuote())
// >> 'Shields up! Rrrrred alert!
// >> ~Riker'

```

I found the list of quotes in [this codepen](https://codepen.io/JeanRC/details/oLJrZo/) 


### Work in Progress
This project is for fun, and will be expanded. PR's welcome, if you want to add a feature, or check any open [Issues](http://github.com/jonchurch/trek-quotes/issues) for ideas where to start.
